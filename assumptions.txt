Approach and Assumptions
Overview
The approach for implementing a task management system using Django and Django REST framework involves creating a RESTful API that supports user registration, authentication, and task management functionalities. This includes CRUD operations for tasks, filtering and searching tasks, and user authentication using JWT tokens.

**1. User Registration and Authentication
Implementation:

RegisterView:

Uses Django's CreateAPIView to handle user registration.
The RegisterSerializer validates and creates new user accounts.
The permission_classes is set to AllowAny to allow unrestricted access for user registration.
LoginView:

Uses Django's GenericAPIView to handle user login.
The LoginSerializer validates user credentials.
The authenticate function from Django is used to verify user credentials.
On successful authentication, JWT tokens are generated using RefreshToken from the rest_framework_simplejwt library and returned in the response.
If authentication fails, an error message is returned with a 400 status code.
Assumptions:

Users can register and log in without restrictions.
JWT is used for authentication, ensuring secure access to API endpoints.
**2. Task Management
Implementation:

TaskViewSet:
Inherits from ModelViewSet to provide CRUD operations for tasks.
permission_classes is set to IsAuthenticated to ensure only authenticated users can access or modify tasks.
Uses DjangoFilterBackend and SearchFilter to allow filtering by status, priority, and due_date, and searching by title and description.
The get_queryset method filters tasks to only include those assigned to the authenticated user.
The perform_create method assigns the task to the authenticated user upon creation.
Custom create, update, and destroy methods handle task creation, updating, and deletion respectively.
Assumptions:

Tasks are associated with users, and each user can only manage their own tasks.
The API supports filtering and searching for tasks based on defined criteria.
**3. Pagination and Filtering
Implementation:

Pagination is supported by default in Django REST framework. Ensure that the pagination_class is configured in the settings.py if needed.
The filter_backends and search_fields attributes in TaskViewSet allow tasks to be filtered and searched based on specified fields.
Assumptions:

Basic filtering and search functionalities are implemented, and additional pagination settings can be adjusted as needed.
**4. Dockerization
Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are configured to containerize the Django application, ensuring that it runs consistently in different environments.
SQLite is used as the database, simplifying the setup by eliminating the need for a separate database service.
Assumptions:

SQLite is chosen for simplicity, and is suitable for development or small-scale applications. For production, a more robust database like PostgreSQL may be preferred.
Summary
The provided approach ensures a secure and efficient implementation of a task management system with user authentication, task management functionalities, and basic filtering and searching. It leverages Django REST framework's capabilities and is Dockerized for ease of deployment.
